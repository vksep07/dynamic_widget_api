# Dymanic Widget App  ( Dynamic Widget Renderer )

The Dynamic Widget Renderer is a Flutter application that demonstrates how to dynamically render widgets from JSON data. It showcases a variety of widgets, including banners and horizontal lists, loaded from a JSON configuration. The app also features dynamic theme support for both light and dark modes, all of which can be configured using JSON data.

In many Flutter applications, the layout and structure of widgets are often defined statically in code. However, there are scenarios where the ability to render widgets dynamically based on external data, such as JSON, can provide great flexibility and reusability. The Dynamic Widget Renderer addresses this need by showing how to create a rendering system that interprets JSON data and generates widget trees at runtime.

In this app we are showing the intaractive UI interface with Dymanic widget Api data  to understand the basic flow. In this project we are using the clean architecture  with following folder breakup -> Parent folder - ( View, Bloc, Network ). We are using the modular approach for reduce the modular dependency between the each module of the project. Clean architecture also decouple the presentation layer and business layer.

## Features
- JSON-Based Widget Rendering: This app leverages JSON data to describe various widgets and their properties. Each JSON entry represents a specific widget type along with its customization options.

- Dynamic Theme Support: The app showcases the ability to apply dynamic themes based on JSON data. Both light and dark modes can be configured, allowing users to switch between themes seamlessly.

- Flexible Widget Types: The renderer supports multiple widget types. As of now, it demonstrates two types: banners and dynamic horizontal lists. However, the architecture is extensible, allowing you to easily add new widget types.

- Responsive UI: The dynamically rendered widgets adapt to various screen sizes and orientations. The renderer maintains a coherent layout even when the content changes dynamically.

- Customization: The app demonstrates how widget properties like images, text, shapes, and themes can be customized using JSON. This customization provides a versatile approach to building UIs that cater to specific design requirements.
